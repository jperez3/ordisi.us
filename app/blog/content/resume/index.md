## Experience

### ChowNow – Senior DevOps Engineer
_Los Angeles, CA September 2019 – December 2025_

- Migrated legacy monolith to **AWS ECS Fargate**, standardising builds across 12 services and minimizing outages via automated roll‑backs.
- Optimized front‑end Docker builds with multi‑stage pipelines, reducing build time **75%** (from 12 min to 3 min).
- Refactored mobile app builder CI pipeline to shave **80%** off build duration via Ansible tuning, enabling faster feedback loops for developers and daily releases.
- Designed and rolled out a **Terraform workspace structure** that supports concurrent workstreams and reduces blast radius for unrelated services
- Developed reusable **Terraform modules** for VPC, IAM, and RDS provisioning, cutting infrastructure‑as‑code onboarding time by **93%** (15 days to 1 day).
- Led MySQL 5.7 to 8.0 migration using **RDS blue‑green deployments**, averting a projected **$560 k/yr** cost increase and achieving zero‑downtime cut‑overs.
- Integrated an acquired‑company’s workloads into IaC, consolidating observability under **Datadog** and improving mean‑time‑to‑detect incidents by **40%**.
- Implemented **Cloudflare WAF/CDN**, decreasing DDoS exposure and off‑loading ~**15%** of web traffic from AWS resources.
- Automated security hardening with **AWS Secrets Manager** and **SSM Patch Manager**, achieving compliance with internal security standards.
- Collaborated with the data team to redesign pipelines, moving from daily refreshes to near‑real‑time reporting while embedding PII‑aware security controls.
- Introduced and championed tooling to streamline engineering processes:
  - **Locust** – load testing and compute‑scaling validation.
  - **GitHub Actions** – automated build & test pipelines.
  - **Pre‑Commit** – shortened feedback loops for infrastructure code.
  - **Packer** – pre‑built AWS AMIs for EC2 workloads.
  - **Cloudflare** - WAF/CDN for security and caching.
  - **AWS ECS Fargate + Lambda** - serverless and container orchestration.
  - **AWS Database Migration Service** – reporting and upgrade automation.
  - **AWS Patch Manager** – automated EC2 patching.
  - **AWS SSM** (SSO + MFA) – replaced SSH with secure authentication.
  - **AWS Secrets Manager** – secure secret storage and rotation.
  - **AWS RDS Blue‑Green Deployments** – near‑zero‑downtime database upgrades.
